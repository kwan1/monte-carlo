A simple exmaple of how monte carlo works, this is to calculate π


make sure to have matplotlib installed:

```pip install matplotlib```

use pip3 if its python3

once that's install, run:

```python test.py``` use python3 if you used pip3

The script will prompt you to enter the number of samples. Enter a positive integer (e.g., 1000, 5000, etc.) and press Enter.

The script will display the estimated value of π and open a graphical window showing the sampled points. The blue points are inside the unit circle, and the red points are outside.
